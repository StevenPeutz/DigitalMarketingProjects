### [ImprovedProxy-facebook_ads](https://github.com/StevenPeutz/WebData-UX_Projects/tree/master/ImprovedProxy-facebook_ads#readme)

- How to leverage facebook adsâ€™ ML to optimize on actual affiliate marketing leads instead of ad clicks or page landings.
As most marketeers will know, running facebook(/instagram) ads directly towards your affiliate link (cloaked or open) can result in a ban. And probably rightfully so keeping UX in mind. This makes it a lot harder to correctly optimize facebook ads and targeting than it is for google ads. I have noticed that this causes a lot of affiliate marketeers to either allocate their resources exclusively towards google ads, or to use ad click (or page landings) as a proxy for leads (/affiliate link clicks) to optimize their facebook ads on.
So I want to share here the way I have been doing it. Please no that this entirely separate from my employment at facebook and is in no way endorsed by facebook or any of their representatives.
